I have quite an extensive collection of rendered images and I noticed I spent a lot of time digging for "that one render with...."
and having no means for a search. That's where this tool comes in handy. Now I can search my output folder by using keywords I would have used during render.

Run ComfyUI_Metadata_Search_Tool_v1.0.exe, select your comfyui output folder.
Enter a few metadata keywords to the search.
If you want to exclude images with certain tags from the results add them under exclusions.

You can also right click on the preview for additional options.
Feel free to let me know about any issues you come across.

Eventually I want to integrate this somehow into comfyUI as a custom node.
