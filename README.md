This script is a GUI-based metadata search tool designed to help users quickly search through .png images—specifically ones generated by ComfyUI or similar tools—by examining the embedded metadata in each file. It was written in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical interface and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to read metadata from image files.



🔍 What it Does

Folder Selection:

The user selects a folder (usually the ComfyUI output folder) using a GUI button.



Metadata Search:

The script scans all .png files in the selected folder (and subfolders), extracting metadata from each image. The user can:



Specify keywords to include



Specify keywords to exclude

It uses regular expressions to match those keywords against the metadata contents.



Results Display:



Matching images are listed in a scrollable list.



The user can click to preview the image in a side panel.



A results counter shows how many images matched and how many were excluded.



🧰 Additional Features

Right-Click Menus:

On the result list or image preview, users can:



Open the image in the system’s default viewer



Open the folder containing the file with the file highlighted



Copy the image's metadata to the clipboard



Copy the file path



Error Logging:

Any errors (like file I/O or subprocess issues) are logged to an error\_log.txt file with a timestamp.



Keyboard Navigation:

Users can navigate results with arrow keys and hit Enter to trigger searches.



"Fun" UI Message:

If the user tries to search without providing both a folder and keyword, the messagebox says:



“((aaahn!~)) So hasty! :3 You have to choose a folder and enter at least one include keyword, step bro.”



💡 Summary

This is a lightweight tool for quickly searching and managing PNG image metadata, tailored to workflows involving ComfyUI image generation. It’s especially useful for creators who want to filter their outputs by prompt, model, or any other metadata stored in the .png headers. The code is cleanly structured and includes useful GUI interactions, previews, and error handling.
